Odin Project NodeJS Course Project #5

I had full functionality of the project and made a minor change to the db schema (now the project is not loading correctly and I don't know where to start in debugging it), I tried for hours to fix it but maybe I will go back and refactor it at a later point in the curriculum
It is extremely frustrating and I will keep trying to find a solution
